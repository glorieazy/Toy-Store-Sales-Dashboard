# Toy-Store-Sales-Dashboard
🚀 Just turned toy chaos into crystal-clear insights—and it’s playful 🧸  

I built a Tableau dashboard for Maven Toys (a fictional toy chain in Mexico) that transforms messy sales & inventory data into actionable business superpowers.  

🔍  Insights

✅ $14M revenue & $4M profit at a 28% margin (yes, toys can be profitable!)  

✅ Top performers: Colorbuds crush revenue ($835K) and also win in volume (68K orders).  

✅ Geographic goldmines: Chilpancingo & Oaxaca lead revenue, while Zacatecas needs a sales boost.  

✅ Category secrets: Toys & Art/Crafts thrive, but Games & Electronics lag.  

🎨 Why this dashboard?

- Data modeling magic: Structured messy transactions into clean, connected tables.  

- Calculated fields galore: From dynamic "Above/Below Avg" trends to margin diagnostics.  

- Aesthetics with purpose: Blue = "winning," orange = "watch out".  

💡 Data isn’t just numbers, it’s the story your business is trying to tell. Let’s make it epic.
